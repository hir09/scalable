# Server Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana

In this tutorial, we will learn how to install three key components for using Prometheus on Docker. These are: 

```
* A Prometheus server to collect metrics and query them
* A Node Exporter to export system metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format
* Grafana, a web-based graphical dashboard builder that supports Prometheus among other backends
```
There are many more components in the Prometheus ecosystem, but these three provide a good starting point for using Prometheus.
